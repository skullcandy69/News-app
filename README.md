# kal_tak_news
 A new Flutter project.
## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
It uses an external api from [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch latest news . It uses BLoC pattern for statemanagement
BLoC:
BLoC stands for Business Logic Components. The gist of BLoC is that everything in the app should be represented as stream of events: widgets submit events; other widgets will respond. BLoC sits in the middle, managing the conversation. Dart even comes with syntax for working with streams that is baked into the language!
